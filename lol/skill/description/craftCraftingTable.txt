async function craftCraftingTable(bot) {
    // The function checks if the bot has at least 4 oak planks in its inventory to craft a crafting table. If there are enough planks, it proceeds to craft a crafting table using the `craftItem` function. After crafting, it verifies if the crafting table was successfully added to the inventory. If the crafting table is present, a success message is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.
