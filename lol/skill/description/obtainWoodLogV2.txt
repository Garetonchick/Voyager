async function obtainWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is designed to obtain a wood log for the bot. It first checks the bot's inventory to see if a wood log already exists. If not, it searches for the nearest log block within a 32-block radius. If no log is found nearby, the bot explores the environment randomly for a short period to locate one. Once a log block is found, it is mined. Finally, the function verifies that a wood log has been successfully added to the inventory and informs the bot.
