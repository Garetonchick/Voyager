async function obtainWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function checks if a jungle log is already in the inventory and returns if it is. If not, it searches for a jungle log block within a 32-block radius. Upon finding a jungle log, the function mines one block. It then verifies if a jungle log was successfully added to the inventory. If successful, a confirmation message is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.
